					<span class="home-corner-first-words">NOVAPEX 2016</span> is now behind us. As always the members of the Redding Stamp Club came together to carry out a flawless Stamp Show for Redding and Northern California. The only downside was the continued decline of public participation. It appears that each year more and more collectors are choosing the internet as an alternative to sitting down with dealers at the show. It is a loss because there is nothing like sitting down with a dealer and actually holding a subject stamp before making a purchase.
				</p>	 
				<p class="home-corner-wrapper-paragraph">
					In any event a good time was had by all. My gratitude goes out to each and every member of the club for their unselfish contributions to its success. Iâ€™m sure they had a grand old time and enjoyed themselves. I know I did. There was plenty of time to sit down with members of the public and talk about stamps. A few have paid dues to become a new club member. I know for them that we as a club will contribute to their growth and fun expanding their collecting interests and fellowship.
				<p class="home-corner-wrapper-paragraph">
					NOVAPEX 2017 is not a likelihood due to the APS Western Show to be held in Reno the first weekend in March, our normal date. The club will be evaluating the next show and how to increase public participation.
				</p>	 
				<p class="home-corner-wrapper-paragraph"> 
					Finally, this website is a new for our club. We have expanded the content considerably from our previous website. To keep it fresh we are looking for any material that would expand our stamp education. Feel free to offer any suggestions. Special thanks go to my son Chris who both designed this site and is its webmaster. Great job Chris!
